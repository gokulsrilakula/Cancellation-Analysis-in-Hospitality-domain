In recent years, City Hotel and Resort Hotel have seen high cancellation rates. Each hotel is now dealing with several issues as a result, including fewer revenues and less-than-ideal hotel room use. Consequently, lowering cancellation rates is both hotels' primary goal to increase their efficiency in generating revenue, and for us to offer thorough business advice to address this problem.
The analysis of hotel booking cancellations as well as other factors that have no bearing on their business and yearly revenue generation are the main topics of this report.



**Research Question**

• What are the variables that affect hotel reservation cancellations?

• How can we make hotel reservation cancellations better?

• How will hotels be assisted in making pricing and promotional decisions?










































**Assumptions**

•	No unusual occurrences between 2015 and 2017 will have a substantial impact on the data used.

•	The information is still current and can be used to analyze a hotel's possible plans in an efficient manner.

•	There are no unanticipated negatives to the hotel employing any advised technique. 4. The hotels are not currently using any of the suggested solutions.

•	The biggest factor affecting the effectiveness of earning income is booking cancellations.

•	Cancellations result in vacant rooms for the booked length of time.

•	Clients make hotel reservations the same year they make cancellations.



**Hypothesis**

•	More cancellations occur when prices are higher.

•	When there is a longer waiting list, customers tend to cancel more frequently.

The above bar graph shows the percentage of reservations that are cancelled and those that are not. It is obvious that there are still a significant number of reservations that have not been cancelled. There are still 37% of clients who cancelled their reservations, which has a substantial impact on the hotels' earnings.

The above line graph shows that, on certain days, the average daily rate for a city hotel is less than that of the resort hotel, and on other days it’s even less. It goes without saying that weekends and holidays may see a rise in hotel rates.

We have developed the grouped bar graph to analyze the months with the highest and lowest reservation levels according to reservation status. As can be seen, both the number of confirmed reservations and the number of cancelled reservations is the largest in the month of August. whereas January is the month with the most cancelled reservations.

This bar graph demonstrates that cancellations are most common when prices are most excellent and are least common when they are lowest. Therefore, the cost of the accommodation is solely responsible for the cancellation.
Now, let's see which country has the highest reservation cancelled. The top country is Portugal with the highest number of cancellations.

The above pie chart shows us the least cancellations country-wise. 5 out of 10 countries have negligible cancellation rates.

Now let’s check the area from where guests are visiting the hotels and making reservations. Is it coming from Direct or Groups, Online or Offline Travel Agents? Around 46% of the clients come from online travel agencies, whereas 27% come from groups. Only 4% of clients book hotels directly by visiting them and making reservations.

The graph shows reservations are cancelled when the average daily rate is higher than when it is not cancelled. It clearly proves all the above analysis, that the higher price leads to higher cancellations.




**Suggestions**


•	Cancellation rates rise as the price does. To prevent cancellations of reservations, hotels could work on their pricing strategies and try to lower the prices for specific hotels based on locations. They can also provide some discounts to the consumers.

•	As the ratio of cancellations and no cancellations of the resort hotel is higher in the resort hotel than in the city hotels. So, the hotels should provide a reasonable discount on the room prices on weekends or on holidays.

•	In the month of January, hotels can start campaigns or marketing with area reasonable amounts to increase their revenue as the cancellation is the highest in this month.

•	They can also increase the quality of their hotels and their services mainly in Portugal to reduce the cancellation rate.
